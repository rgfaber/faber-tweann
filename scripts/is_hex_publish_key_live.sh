# Is HEX_API_KEY set, and does hex.pm accept it? Run FIRST in the publish job,
# before anything is published. Ported from macula-io/macula (2026-10-03).
#
# The key lives only in the `hex-publish' environment, which admits v* tags
# alone, so nothing can inspect it before a tag. A key that is blank or
# revoked used to fail only inside `rebar3 hex publish'. This names the cause
# in one line instead. The secret is read at RUN time, so after fixing the
# key, re-running the failed job is enough: nothing was published and the
# version is not burned.
#
# The question publishing needs answered is whether the key may WRITE, and
# hex.pm answers it at /api/auth?domain=api&resource=write:
#   200/204  the key may write        -> accept
#   401      no key, or one rejected  -> refuse
#   403      a valid key that may not write -> refuse: it cannot publish
# Anything else (hex.pm down, network) also refuses. The value is never
# printed.
#
# Usage (publish job, env HEX_API_KEY: secrets.HEX_API_KEY):
#   bash scripts/is_hex_publish_key_live.sh
